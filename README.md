## USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

### Project Aim
The town of Camelot is under alockdown of a terrible Plague. It has been many moons and many frustrating dictatorship like rules. A small undergound group of Robin Hood like characters are planning on creating a sequel to their successful tournamnt held in the early days of the first lockdown. They see a growing number of men are getting increasingly angry especially the past few days and can see that in any day, a great revolution will occur if they don't participate in a physical activity to steam out any stress.
The group have asked me to create a website for their upcoming football tournament. This website must help promote the event and get as many people involved in order to prevent a revolke.

### User Stories
* First time visitor goals:
    * As a first time user, I want to be evoked with exitement and interest as playing football is a hobby/passion; especially in a competitve format. 
    * I want to be able to find out the main details of the website which are where and when the tournament will be held, and how the tournament will be held. 
    * I will also want to be able to get a glimse of the tournament such as pictures of their last tournament. 
    * Registering for the tournament should be easy as I and most people of this town have clear short attention spans.
* Returning visitor goals:
    * I want to be able to go through any part of the website for reasons such as reconsidering, rereading anything I might not have remembered misunderstood, show my friends the website and most importantly, being able to register my team after I get my friends to join me.
    * Contact details will be helpful if I have any questions.
* Frequent user goals:
As a requent user, I want to be able to reread the details of the tournament as the date comes closer. A gallery will be helpful in getting myself and my team mates to get excited.



### Design
* Colour scheme:
The colour scheme will have a 'cool' look to attract the young audience. The colours will also lean towards a darker and sporty tone to suit the theme of the aim of the website; a secret football tournament.
I have chosen tones of yellow, orange, grey and adn white. The chosen colours were found and slightly altered using the website visme.co.
* Typography:
I looked at a few font-style for googleFonts.com and decided the original font-style complimented the colour and theme of the website best. It is simple and doesn't distract the user.
* Imagery:
The imagery had to represent secrecy and excitement. The header section containes a background-iamge of a football game played in a dark flood-lighted pitch. This dark theme tells the user a lot about the theme of the wewbsite and also compliments the colour theme of the website. A fixed background-image of an animated football stand helps get the user to start iamging them selves playing in the tournament. Having a gallery page of the previous tournament was included to show what the tournament is capable of; exciting football.

## Features
* The website will be responsive on mobile, tablet and monitor devices. Some obvious and not so obvious parts of the website alter depending on screen size
* Clicking on the register button in the registration section has a modal linked to it. It contains a short message regarding letting the user know registration has been completed and joining the tournament. A carousel component was used for the gallery section. The user will be able to click on left and right buttons to flick throuhg the pictures in the gallery.

## Technologies used
* Languages: Three languages were used to create this project; HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It should be noted that the javascript codes was not created by me but by those who created the bootstrap framework. It was needed for the modal and carousel to work and dropdown menu of the nav tab whilst on a mobile screen size.
* Frameworks: 
    * Bootstrap 5.0 - This was mainly used for the layout and responsiveness of the website
    * Font Awesome - This was used mainly for the icons included on the website
    * Git - This was used for version control
    * Github - Git pushed the projects to my GitHub
    * Balsamiq - This was used to design the initial structure and design of the website
* External Resources:
    * The code for the navigation bar was copied from the bootsrap website; I chose the 'Expand at sm' template. I altered it a little to suit the needs of the website. - [link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/navbars/)
    * The code for the carousel in the 'gallery' section was copied from the bootstrap website; I chose the 'Slides Only' template. - [link](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/carousel/#slides-only)

### UX testing
#### First time visitor goals:
1. As a first time user, I want to be evoked with exitement and interest as playing football is a hobby/passion; especially in a competitve format.
    * The hero image of people playing football ina floodlight, islotaed pitch triggers the secret and excitement theme of the tournament.

2. I want to be able to find out the main details of the website which are where and when the tournament will be held, and how the tournament will be held. 
    * After the intriguemnt caused by the hero-image, scrolling down or clicking on the link next to the 'Home' link, the 'How it works' link, leads me straight to the main details of how the tournament is runned and how to take part.
3. I will also want to be able to get a glimse of the tournament such as pictures of their last tournament.
    * A gallery section shows me an array of pictures from the previous tournament. This gives the user an image of what to expect.
4. Registering for the tournament should be easy as I and most people of this town have clear short attention spans.
    * The registration asks very little and basic information. It looks simple and attractive throught the simplicity of the design. It is simple enough for the average user attention span.

#### Returning visitor goals:
1. I want to be able to go through any part of the website for reasons such as reconsidering, rereading anything I might not have remembered misunderstood, show my friends the website and most importantly, being able to register my team after I get my friends to join me. 
    * A navigation bar that constantly stays at the top of the page lets the user move from one section of the page to another with ease. It does not clutter the page especially on the mobile app as the links are within the toggle button in a tidy manner.

#### Frequent user goals:
1. I want to be able to reread the details of the tournament as the date comes closer.
    * Easy navigation around the website helps the user find what they want with the use of a static navabr thats stays ontop of the page.
2. A gallery will be helpful in getting myself and my team mates to get excited.
    * A gallery section is important in evoking the feeling of wanting to 'really' join the tournament. Pictures of the intensity of the previous tournament are chosen to help this.

### Further testing
* The website on all screen sizes and format was tested on Google Chrome. They appeared as intended.
*  All links link and open to attended targets and as intended.

### Known bugs
* In the carousel, when images are sliding to the next image, sometimes you can see a little of the background image close to the bottom border area. It is slightly noticable.
